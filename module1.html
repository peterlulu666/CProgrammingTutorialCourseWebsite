                    <p>
                    In this module, we will look at the basic types of data on which
                    computers operate, including numerical and logical values, as well as
                    characters that represent textual information  We will also learn how
                    to create sequences of instructions that perform calculations on data using
                    operations that are built-in to the C programming language.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Next we will learn how to define our own operations that combine
                    sequences of instructions to perform more sophisticated calculations.
                    A benefit of these programmer-defined <em>functions</em> or
                    <em>procedures</em>, is that they can be reused whereever they are
                    required, rather than having to repeat the same sequences for new
                    data values.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Finally, we will learn how to specify conditions that enable performing
                    different sequences of operations based on current data values. Conditions
                    can also be used to repeatedly perform the same calculation for data whose
                    values change as the calculation is performed. We will also learn about
                    a different way to use functions or procedures to repeat a calculation.

                <h3>Program Basics: Types, Statements, Operators, and Expressions</h3>
				<p>
                This lesson covers the basics of a program, which includes both data and
                instructions. It begins by introducing the idea of a <em>data type</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                Almost every programming language associates data with types. As we saw in
                Lecture 1, a value stored in memory occupies a certain number of bytes, and
                computer instructions are designed to operate on data of specific types.
                These data types and instructions are directly reflected in the C programming
                language.
                </p>
                <p>
                The C language allows a developer to identify a value in memory by a
                symbolic name called a <em>variable</em> that indicates its purpose and its
                data type. This enables a compiler that translates a C program into computer
                instructions to use the appropriate instructions for the type. The term
                "variable" is used because the value of that memory may be changed by the
                program.
                </p>

                <p>
                Next the lessson shows how C instructions in the form of <em>statements</em>
                can be executed one after another to implement a program that performs a
                particular task. Statements consist of <em>expressions</em> that combine values
                and operators. <em>Operators</em> transform input values into an output values
                that can be used as input to other operators. The results are ultimately stored
                in memory for later use. C enables writing even complicated expressons very
                compactly, using a notation that is similar to standard mathematical notaton.
                </p>

                <p>
                This lesson reviews the built-in C operators for various data types, and
                illustrates the many ways that data and operators can be combined into
                expressions and statements.
                </p>

                <h3>Defining and Calling Functions</h3>
				<p>
                Functions are a way to create new operations that can be combined with built-in
                operators and other functions. There are two purposes for defining functions. One
                is to specify some functionality just once and then reuse it wherever it is needed,
                rather than repeating the same sequence of statements for each new set of values.
                </p>
                <p>
                The other purpose is to make the program more understandable by replacing a sequence
                of statements with the use of a function whose name describes what it does. This is
                often referred to as <em>encapsulation</em>. The process of designing a program that
                breaks a complex problem into a set of functions that are easier to design, use, test,
                and maintain is known as <em>functional decomposition</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                In this lesson, we will learn how to define a function with <em>formal parameters</em>
                that are place-holders for actual values the function uses, and how to <em>return</em>
                the result of the function. Then we will see how to <em>call</em> the function with
                <em>actual parameter values</em>, and use the returned result. We will also survey a few
                of the libraries of pre-defined functions that C provides. Finally, we will look at a
                few examples of functional decomposition to understand this important design paradigm.

                <h3>Decision Making, Conditional Processing, and Repetition</h3>
				<p>
                The sequence of instructions to perform often depends on values that were computed by
                previous instructions. If a certain value is less than another value, for example, one
                sequence of instructions applies, otherwise a different sequence of instructions is
                performed.  The C language provides conditional processing constructs that control
                which sequence of instructions to perform. These constructs are controlled by logical
                expressions that combine built-in C logical and comparison operators and functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some computations require repeating a set of instructions, using the results of
                previous instructions or repetitions to determine whether to continue
                repeating the instructions. The C language provides several conditional processing
                constructs called <em>loops</em> that repeat a set of instructions until a logical
                expression becomes false or while a logical expression evaluates as true.
                </p>
                <p>
                In this lesson, we will look at the various conditional processing constructs provided
                by the C language, and also see how these constructs can be combined to implement more
                advanced conditional processing operations.

                <p>
                Include all the specified functions in a file "assignment-2.c". Include a main
                program that tests the functions by calling them with test data and printing the results returned
                by the functions. Include comments for the tests that describe their purposes.
                Label the output so someone else can understand it. </p>
                <p>Provide a documentation block for for the file that includes the name of the file, its creation date, its author, and a brief description the file. Also provide a documentation block each function describing its purpose,
                parameters, and return values as appropriate. Check your file in to the CCIS
                GitHub repository 2018FACS5001SV/assignment-2-<em>ccisID</em> that was created
                by your instructor for your ccisID.

                <h4>Function <em>countCalls</em></h4>
                <p>
                Create a function <em>unsigned int countCalls(bool reset)</em>
                with a static unsigned in <em>problem1Count</em> to count the number of
                times the function is called. If called with <em>false</em>, the function increments
                <em>problem1Count</em> and returns 0.
                If called with <em>true</em>, the function resets <em>problem1Count</em> to 0 and
                returns the number of times the function was called since the last time it was reset.
                </p>
                <p>
                Call this function from <em>main</em> several times with <em>false</em> to build up a
                count, then call it with <em>true</em>. Report the value returned from the function
                for each call. By way of example, if the function is called four times with
                <em>false</em>, it returns 0 each time. If then called with <em>true</em>, it
                returns 4 and resets <em>problem1Count</em> back to 0.

                <h4>Function pi</h4>
				<p>
                Write a function <em>double pi()</em> that approximates value of pi to the precision of a double:
                3.14159265358979 using an approximation
                technique that is the sum of the series
                <br/>
                3 + 4/(2*3*4) - 4/(4*5*6) + 4/(6*7*8) - 4/(8*9*10) ...
                </p>
                <p>
                Use a loop to add successive tems of the series until the previous sum and sum with the next term are the same.  Return this value as the result of the function.
                </p>
                <h4>Function <em>daysInMonth</em></h4>
                <p>
                Write a function <em>unsigned short daysInMonth(unsigned int month)</em>. The function
                takes a month number between 1 (Janauary) and 12 (December), and uses a switch
                statement to set a local unsigned short variable <em>numDays</em> to the number of days in any month (assuming 28 for February). Return <em>numDays</em> at the end of the function.  If the input value
                is not a valid month number, return 0 from the function. Be sure to include this behaviour in your function documenation.</p>
